</s>What did Rutherford discover?

Rutherford discovered that the nucleus of an atom is made up of protons and neutrons. He also discovered that the nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of electrons.

What is the difference between a proton and a neutron?

A proton is a positively charged particle. A neutron is a negatively

</s>What did Rutherford discover?
He discovered that they were all fake.</s>I really don't know what to say.  I'm sorry you are going through this.  But I am wondering if you are trying to make a point.  I'm not sure what you are trying to say.  I think you

</s>What did Rutherford discover?
I think he thought that the Earth was a sphere, but the Earth was actually flat.
I think you're right, but I don't know why that's relevant.
He was a very influential person in the creation of the modern scientific community.</s>I mean, I'd be
